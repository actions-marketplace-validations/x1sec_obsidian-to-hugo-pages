# Obsidian notes to static Hugo website on Github pages workflow

Github workflow action that converts Obsidian notes to a static website hosted in Github pages

The conversion from Obsidian Markdown to Hugo is done by running [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) and adding a modification to the default template layout to fix relative URIs for links and images embedded in the Obsidian notes.
